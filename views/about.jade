            h1 About <span class="orange">GIFsmos</span>
            p Got a mathy blog or website? Then you know that sometimes a static image just won't do. That's where <span class="orange">GIFsmos</span> comes in. Take any dynamic <a href="https://www.desmos.com/">Desmos</a> graph and GIF-ify it, like so:
            a(href='https://www.desmos.com/calculator/s0bjllhwwa')
                img.img-rounded.center-block.demo-image(src='/images/curvature.gif')
            p Start by creating a brand new graph, or import one that you've already got saved. (If you're not sure how to use the calculator, now's a good time to head over to <a href="https://www.desmos.com/">Desmos.com</a> and learn about an awesome tool.) Then just hit record, drag your parameters around, and hit stop.
            p That's it. Each time you record you'll see a preview of your animated GIF, and whenever you're happy you can download the full-size version to paste up all over the Internet.  Enjoy!

            p.text-muted <span class="orange">GIFsmos</span> has the <a href="https://www.desmos.com/api/v0.4/docs/">Desmos API</a> as its beating heart, and uses the <a href="https://yahoo.github.io/gifshot/">GifShot</a> library from the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> team to generate the animated images.
